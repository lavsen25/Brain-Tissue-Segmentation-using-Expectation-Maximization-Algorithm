# Brain-Tissue-Segmentation-using-Expectation-Maximization-Algorithm

The Expectation Maximization Algorithm is used to segment the brain tissues into CSF, GM and WM. The algorithm uses the 2 MRI modalities T1-Weighted and Flair and uses both modalities to perform the segmentation. Dice Coefficient is used as performance metric. The code is written in MATLAB 2018b.
